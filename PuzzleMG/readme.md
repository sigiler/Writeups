Received the puzzle and was asked to "solve it".
See image in the folder. 15 tiles with colors in the sides and pretty curves.
Along it had a vague phrase and no context to what a solution should be.

Decided to try to make a 3x5 board where all colours match.
Lost an hour trying combinations to achieve but at least got used to the problem.

Picked up the big guns (Z3) to solve the problem and learn use it.
After being transformed into formulas, asking solver for values that satisfy the formula gives us a solution, look the other image.
Adding another restriction that prohibits the known solution gives at least another solution (manually checked to not be symmetric).

Got bored and stashed all this away. So there you go, yet another puzzle solved using Z3.
